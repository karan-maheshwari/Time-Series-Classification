# Time Series Classification of human activities based on time series data

#### a) Extracting time domain features from the data and plotting scatterplots
#### b) Building a 90% bootsrap confidence interval for the standard deviation of each feature
#### c) Perform Binary Classification Using Logistic Regression
#### d) Evaluating performance using Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation
#### e) Analyzing performance using ROC, AUC, P-Values, and Confusion Matrix
#### f) Performing under sampling to overcome the imbalance in the dataset
#### g) Performing Binary Classification Using L1-penalized logistic regression and comparing with the previos model
#### h) Perform Multi-Class Classification using L1 Penalized Multinomial Regression
#### i) Using Mutinomial Naive Bayes and Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier and comparing performance with the previos model
